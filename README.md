# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a model that will determine whether or not the 34,000 organizations Alphabet Soup's business team has data on will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Results

## Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  * IS_SUCCESSFUL
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  * EIN and NAME

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
